# Gofighter

Gofighter is a library for [Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io). The main point is for me to learn more Go.

The library will continue to grow, but currently implements:

* Calls to the entire web API
* WebSockets

Example programs are at [gofighter_examples](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/gofighter_examples).
